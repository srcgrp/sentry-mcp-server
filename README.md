# Sentry MCP Server

**Integrate Sentry error tracking directly into your development workflow with this Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.**

Gain insights into your application's stability by accessing Sentry release health data and issue details without leaving your MCP-enabled environment (like VS Code with the Cline extension).

## Key Features
- **Release Monitoring:** List recent releases and view their associated new issue counts.
- **Release Health:** Get detailed statistics for specific releases, including crash-free rates and session counts.
- **Issue Investigation:** Fetch detailed information about specific Sentry issues by their ID.
- **Targeted Issue Listing:** Retrieve all issues associated with a particular release version.
- **Flexible Connection:** Works with both Sentry.io (cloud) and self-hosted Sentry instances.
- **Server Inspection:** Includes a tool to verify configuration and server status.

## Setup

1.  **Install the Server:**
    ```bash
    npm install -g sentry-mcp-server 
    # Note: Replace 'sentry-mcp-server' with the actual published package name if different.
    # You might need sudo depending on your npm permissions.
    ```

2.  **Configure MCP Client:**
    Add the server to your MCP client's configuration file (e.g., `cline_mcp_settings.json` for Cline):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sentry": { // You can choose any name here
          "command": "sentry-mcp-server", // Use the command name from installation
          "args": [],
          "env": {
            // Environment variables will be loaded from your .env file (see below)
          },
          "disabled": false, // Ensure it's enabled
          "autoApprove": [] 
        }
        // ... other servers
      }
    }
    ```
    *Restart your MCP client (e.g., reload VS Code) after modifying the settings.*

3.  **Create `.env` File:**
    In the directory where you run your MCP client (or a location accessible by it), create a `.env` file with the following required variables:

    ```dotenv
    # Required Sentry Credentials & Configuration
    SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN"  # Generate from Sentry > User Settings > API Keys
    SENTRY_BASE_URL="YOUR_SENTRY_API_ENDPOINT" # e.g., https://sentry.io/api/0/ or https://your-sentry-instance.com/api/0/
    SENTRY_ORG_SLUG="your-organization-slug"   # Your Sentry organization slug
    ```
    *Replace the placeholder values with your actual Sentry details.*

## Configuration Details
The server relies on these environment variables (typically set in the `.env` file):

-   **`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (Required):** Your Sentry API authentication token. Grants the server permission to access your Sentry data.
-   **`SENTRY_BASE_URL` (Required):** The base URL for the Sentry API. For Sentry.io cloud users, this is usually `https://sentry.io/api/0/`. For self-hosted instances, use your instance's API endpoint.
-   **`SENTRY_ORG_SLUG` (Required):** The unique identifier (slug) for your organization within Sentry. This is used as the default organization for API calls unless overridden in specific tool arguments.
